  <history>
    The team was formed during our first Semester of our masters degree at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences.
    From the first to the third semester, basically 1.5 years, we had to come up with a game project. 
    After Hannah talked with Jan, they got Kerstin, Nessi (Tran Khiet Van Ho), Marcell and Jeannette on board.
    Additionally, after looking for somebody to create the music and sound effects for our game, Lou (Lukas Schönwiese) from the
    bachelors degree decided to join us as well.
